# [SHADER BOX](https://github.com/valentingalea/shaderbox)
![Snapshot of the apps](apps.png)

Various experiments with raytracing and
raymarching done only in pixel (fragment) shaders.

Written in GLSL but supports C++ and HLSL
using preprocessor macro tricks.
The C++11 work is made possible by the
wonderful [CxxSwizzle library](https://github.com/gwiazdorrr/CxxSwizzle).

## Projects
The various submodules are enabled via global defines:

## Features
Over time various things were added and some
can be extracted and used separately.

* minimal raytracer framework
* minimal Cook-Torrence lighting and material setup
* signed distance field functions and operators
* 2D two bone IK solver
* a library of different noise functions
* Rayleigh/Mie atmospheric scattering solver
* a bare-bones #include expander utility to compose files
