# [SHADER BOX](https://github.com/valentingalea/shaderbox)
![snapshot of apps](http://valentingalea.github.io/shaderbox/apps.png)

Various experiments with raytracing and
raymarching done only in pixel (fragment) shaders.

Written in GLSL but supports C++ and HLSL
using preprocessor macro tricks.
The C++11 work is made possible by the
wonderful CxxSwizzle library.

## Projects
The various submodules are enabled via global defines:

## Support
* Visual Studio C++ 2015. Has a dependency on SDL 1.2 (included).
* [C4droid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.n0n3m4.droidc&hl=en_GB) on Android.
* any GLSL ES environment. Tested on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and [GLSL Sandbox](http://glslsandbox.com/).
* any DirectX 11 HLSL environment. Tested with included hlsltoy utility.

## Features
Over time various things were added and some
can be extracted and used separately.

* minimal raytracer framework
* minimal Cook-Torrence lighting and material setup
* signed distance field functions and operators
* 2D two bone IK solver
* a library of different noise functions
* Rayleigh/Mie atmospheric scattering solver
* primitive animated GIF output

## Utilities
The util/ folder contains separate, independent projects:

Project   | Description
----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inclxpnd  | a bare-bones #include expander utility to compose files
hlsltoy   | minimal one-file DX 11 framework that runs a fullscreen pixel shader
